# Samba_de_Koala

FUN FACT: Koalas are known for their extensive sleep habits, typically sleeping between 18 to 22 hours per day.

Some of my labmates have an unhealthy sleep schedule (either sleep rly late or sleep too long). 
They aren't as bad as a koala but I hope to solve their problem with this program.

The program uses pillow (PIL) and numpy. If these are not installed in your (or your friend's) computer, the program will not operate properly. Please make sure that the two libraries are installed (if the computer does not have python, you will need to start from downloading python).

You may change the name of the gif file. However, keep in mind that you will need to make the changes to the path in the code as well.
The datetime package is commented out in case someone wants to make the program pop out a window on a specific time. Otherwise, the code should work untouched.

If you happen to browse through this code, you will realize that the window will pop out in fullscreen. Do not problem! You can tab out and stop the program by the classic "Control-c" on the terminal. Otherwise, you may try the several options I added which will terminate the running program. The options are "Control-w", "Control-q", and "Escape" (all of them are keyboard input).
